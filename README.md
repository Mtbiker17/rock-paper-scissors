This program is an Odin Project assignment asking the user to create a series of functions to play the game "rock, paper, scissors" against the computer. 

We are focusing on functions, how the operate and how to write them properly; but more importantly, this is an assignment challenging the students ability to problem solve and "pseudocode." 

The previous coursework in the Odin Project iterated the fact that a good programmer needs to have strong abilities in write comments and pseudocode. AN interesting pointer was that the syntax and language is important, but its even more important to be able to explain the problem/algorithm in plain English! 

Here I'll be working to follow the problem solving process. Understand, Plan, Divide.
Understand - write out the problem in plain English, understand the problem you are trying to solve as a whole.
Plan - Write out some pseudocode to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Write out the exact steps.
Divide - Solve the sub-problems, simplest first. Then connect the dots.

!important<COMMENTS ARE CODE!> (code explains your comments to the computer!)

UPDATE: 11/26 - This project was challenging on a few fronts. I had gone over the functions aspect of The Odin Academy, but they seemed pretty foreign to me at the time of this assignment. Like I've heard from other programmers, new people try start from scratch...and then scratch their heads. I felt this way. I am guilty of perusing through other solutions in order to spark my own code. While I am not satisfied I could't write it from scratch, I still tried my hardest to only get small hints from other code and then create my own and problem solve from there.

I began with writing pseudocode, I found this INCREDIBLY helpful. I then tried to break the problem down into smaller problems. I was able to do this, but as a beginner, I didn't quite do it in the order I perhaps should have - this was a lesson I learned from this project.

Overall, I made great progress with understand how functions work as well the ability to create functions early to call them later. Looking forward to getting better at functions!
