This program is an Odin Project assignment asking the user to create a series of functions to play the game "rock, paper, scissors" against the computer. 

We are focusing on functions, how the operate and how to write them properly; but more importantly, this is an assignment challenging the students ability to problem solve and "pseudocode." 

The previous coursework in the Odin Project iterated the fact that a good programmer needs to have strong abilities in write comments and pseudocode. AN interesting pointer was that the syntax and language is important, but its even more important to be able to explain the problem/algorithm in plain English! 

Here I'll be working to follow the problem solving process. Understand, Plan, Divide.
Understand - write out the problem in plain English, understand the problem you are trying to solve as a whole.
Plan - Write out some pseudocode to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Write out the exact steps.
Divide - Solve the sub-problems, simplest first. Then connect the dots.
