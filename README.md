This program is an Odin Project assignment asking the user to create a series of functions to play the game "rock, paper, scissors" against the computer. 

Focusing on functions, how they operate and how to write them properly.

The previous coursework in the Odin Project iterated the fact that a good programmer needs to have strong abilities in write comments and pseudocode. AN interesting pointer was that the syntax and language is important, but its even more important to be able to explain the problem/algorithm in plain English! 

What I learned: 

 - Made great progress in understanding and writing functions as well as the scope of variables declared in and out of functions.
 - Made great progress in understanding the DOM and how to manipulate it.
 - Learned a few new methods in the JavaScript toolbox.
 - Attempted to follow problem solving process. Understand, Plan, Divide.
UNDERSTAND:
write out the problem in plain English, understand the problem you are trying to solve as a whole.
PLAN:
Write out some pseudocode to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Write out the exact steps.
DIVIDE:
Solve the sub-problems, simplest first. Then connect the dots.

While I did do this on some fronts, I could have been better. I'd like to try these methods more in depth in the next project.
