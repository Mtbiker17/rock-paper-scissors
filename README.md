This program is an Odin Project assignment asking the user to create a series of functions to play the game "rock, paper, scissors" against the computer. 

What I learned: 

 - Made great progress in understanding and writing functions as well as the scope of variables declared in and out of functions.
 - Made great progress in understanding the DOM and how to manipulate it.
 - Learned a few new methods in the JavaScript toolbox.
 - Attempted to follow problem solving process. Understand, Plan, Divide.
UNDERSTAND:
write out the problem in plain English, understand the problem you are trying to solve as a whole.
PLAN:
Write out some pseudocode to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Write out the exact steps.
DIVIDE:
Solve the sub-problems, simplest first. Then connect the dots.
